#SpeakEasy

SpeakEasy is a collection of communication libraries.  SpeakEasy includes:
* A number of protocol stacks with a consistent metaphor
* Infrastructure to implement the protocol stacks
* Higher-level client and server APIs to simplify the consumption and use of the protocol stacks

SpeakEasy is a work in progress and is not yet ready for use in anything real.
